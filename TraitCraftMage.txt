Casting
---------

6 Yes, and      great success with positive side-effect

3 No, but       a different prositive effect happens
2 No
1 No, and       a different negative effect happens

Paradox
-------

### How you get paradox

You get one paradox when you perform magic against the concensus observed by sleepers.
You can improve your die result by one category if you voluntarily take a leval of paradox
Whenever you gain paradox you roll with your magic score vs your current level
of Paradox. Asking Do I suffer backlash now?

Sleepers don't get Paradox. Agents that just use 'hyper-tech' don't get paradox.
Technocracy wizzards that just use 'hyper-tech' don't get paradox, but if they
use magic they get paradox as normal.

### Backlash

A magic effect of the "size" of the paradox affects you in a negative way.

On a "yes, and ..." result you take damage equal to the paradox inaddition to what the effect does to you.

Then erase all your paradox

6 Yes, and      
5 Yes
4 Yes, but     
3 No, but       
2 No            You suffer an effect of the PARADOX level    
1 No, and       In addition to the backlash you also get PARADOX damage from directly disruping your pattern

### Getting rid of Paradox

Spending a day performing rituals of your tradition without changing reality
allows a roll to get rid of one paradox. Roll on Treadition, add a die if you
are on a node.

If you spend more time withoout making rolls you can add a die for each
additional day taken.

Spheres
-------

[See](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mage:_The_Ascension#The_Technocratic_Union)

Prime -> Mind -> Spirit -> Forces -> Matter -> Life -> Correspondence -> Time -> Entropy -> 

### Correspondence

Deals with spatial relations, giving the Mage power over space and distances.
Correspondence magic allows powers such as teleportation, seeing into distant
areas, and at higher levels the Mage may also co-locate herself or even stack
different spaces within each other. Correspondence can be combined with almost
any other sphere to create effects that span distances.

0 Detect presence of correspondance
1 
2 Teleport

+1 Many items
+1 Life subjects


### Entropy

This sphere gives the Mage power over order, chaos, fate and fortune. A mage can
sense where elements of chance influence the world and manipulate them to some
degree. At simple levels machines can be made to fail, plans to go off without a
hitch, and games of chance heavily influenced. Advanced mages can craft
self-propagating memes or curse entire family lines with blights. The only
requirement of the Entropy sphere is that all interventions work within the
general flow of natural entropy. Forces

### Forces

concerns energies and natural forces and their negative opposites (i.e.
light and shadow can both be manipulated independently with this Sphere).
Essentially, anything in the material world that can be seen or felt but is not
material can be controlled: electricity, gravity, magnetism, friction, heat,
motion, fire, etc. At low levels the mage can control forces on a small scale,
changing their direction, converting one energy into another. At high levels,
storms and explosions can be conjured. Obviously, this Sphere tends to do the
most damage and is the most flashy and vulgar. Along with Life and Matter,
Forces is one of the three 'Pattern Spheres' which together are able to mold all
aspects of the physical world. Life

### Life

deals with understanding and influencing biological systems. Generally
speaking, any material object with mostly living cells falls under the influence
of this sphere. Simply, this allows the mage to heal herself or metamorphose
simple life-forms at lower levels, working up to healing others and controlling
more complex life at higher levels. Usually, seeking to improve a complex
life-form beyond natural limits causes the condition of pattern bleeding: the
affected life form begins to wither and die over time. Along with Matter and
Forces, Life is one of the three Pattern Spheres.

### Mind

Dealing with control over one's own mind, the reading and influencing of other
minds, and a variety of subtler applications such as Astral Projection and
psychometry. At high levels, Mages can create new complete minds or completely
rework existing ones. Matter

### Matter

deals with all inanimate material. Thus, being alive protects a thing
from direct manipulation by the Matter sphere. Stone, dead wood, water, gold,
and the corpses of once living things are only the beginning. With this Sphere,
matter can be reshaped mentally, transmuted into another substance, or given
altered properties. Along with Life and Forces, Matter is one of the three
Pattern Spheres.

### Prime

This sphere deals directly with Quintessence, the raw material of the tapestry,
which is the metaphysical structure of reality. This sphere allows Quintessence
to be channeled and/or funneled in any way at higher levels, and it is necessary
if the mage ever wants to conjure something out of nothing (as opposed to
transforming one pattern into another). Uses of Prime include general magic
senses, counter-magic, and making magical effects permanent.

### Spirit

This sphere is an eclectic mixture of abilities relating to dealings with the
spirit world or Umbra. It includes stepping into the Near Umbra right up to
traveling through outer space, contacting and controlling spirits, communing
with your own or others' avatars, returning a Mage into a sleeper, returning
ghosts to life, creating magical fetish items, and so forth. Unlike other
Spheres, the difficulty of Spirit magic is often a factor of the Gauntlet,
making these spells more difficult for the most part. The Sphere is referred to
as Dimensional Science by the Technocratic Union.

### Time

This sphere deals with dilating, slowing, stopping or traveling through time.
Due to game mechanics, it is simpler to travel forward in time than backwards.
Time can be used to install delays into spells, view the past or future, and
even pull people and objects out of linear progression. Time magic offers one
means to speed up a character to get multiple actions in a combat round, a much
coveted power in turn-based combat.
