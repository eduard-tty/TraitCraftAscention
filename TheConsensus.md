The Concensus
=============

Pregame
-------

This is a game of power fantansy, about creatively and judiciously
applying this power and deciding what you stand for.

Technology will largely be the enemy. (Technocracy)

We will be testing out some rules I've created. They are open to change
and if we find out that it does not work for us we can switch to
the Official Mage: The Aascention rules.

### Mage Invitation

"A beautiful handwritten rolled up scroll without stamp or adress"

Dear children. It is imperative that we meet and before you meet with
any other you do not yet know well.

Find me at The Amsterdam within Amsterdam, where the crow does not fly.

Trust your intuition and don't bring your phone!

Please burn this letter after you have read it.
